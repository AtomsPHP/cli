# atoms/cli

The command-line tool for creating, validating, building, running, deploying,
inspecting, and rolling back Atoms applications. Builds are deterministic and
do not execute customer code; Cloudflare operations use the Wrangler binary
already installed in the scaffolded Worker project.

```sh
composer require --dev atoms/cli:^0.1
vendor/bin/atoms --help
```

Start with the [installation guide](https://docs.atomsphp.dev/getting-started/install/).
